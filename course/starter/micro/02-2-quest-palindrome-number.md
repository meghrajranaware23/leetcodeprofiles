## 🎯 Try the Problem First

Open the problem on LeetCode and attempt it **before** reading hints or solutions.

**[→ Open Palindrome Number on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)**

> ⚔ **Mentor's rule:** Spend at least 5 minutes with pen and paper. Apply today's skill: **Problem Reading**. The hints below are for *after* your attempt.

## The Problem

Given the problem on LeetCode, apply today's skill: **Problem Reading**.

**[→ Open Palindrome Number on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)** for the full statement, examples, and constraints.

---

## 💡 Hints

1. Re-read the constraints — what edge cases do they hint at?
2. Trace Example 1 by hand before writing any code
3. Start with the simplest approach that could work (brute force is fine)

## 🔍 Strategy Breakdown

**Skill practiced today:** Problem Reading

**Why this problem:** Clean examples, clear constraints, good for practicing the reading framework

**How to read this problem:**
1. What is the input? What is the output?
2. What do the examples tell you about the expected behavior?
3. What's the simplest approach that handles all examples?

**How a mentor thinks (before coding):**
1. *"I've seen this type — it's about problem reading."*
2. *"Let me trace Example 1 on paper first."*
3. *"What's my brute force? Does it fit the constraints?"*
4. *"Only then do I open my editor."*

## ❌ Why Jumping to Code Fails

| Approach | Problem |
|---|---|
| Open editor immediately | You code before understanding — bugs multiply |
| Skip example tracing | You miss edge cases the examples reveal |
| Copy without understanding | You can't re-solve tomorrow without the editorial |
| Give up before 5 minutes | You never build the "attempt first" habit |

> **The insight:** Speed comes from **process**, not from skipping steps.

## 📖 Walkthrough

Trace Example 1 on paper step by step. Write your brute force in plain English (3 lines). Only then translate to code.

> 💡 **The code is just the paper trace written in syntax.**

## Solution

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(int x) {
        if (x < 0 || (x % 10 == 0 && x != 0)) return false;
        int rev = 0;
        while (x > rev) { rev = rev * 10 + x % 10; x /= 10; }
        return x == rev || x == rev / 10;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        if x < 0 or (x % 10 == 0 and x != 0): return False
        rev = 0
        while x > rev:
            rev = rev * 10 + x % 10
            x //= 10
        return x == rev or x == rev // 10
```

### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        if (x < 0 || (x % 10 == 0 && x != 0)) return false;
        int rev = 0;
        while (x > rev) { rev = rev * 10 + x % 10; x /= 10; }
        return x == rev || x == rev / 10;
    }
}
```

**Complexity:** O(log n) time · O(1) space

## 💭 What a Mentor Would Tell You

- *"I didn't need the optimal solution — I needed a **correct** solution with a clear process."*
- *"Tracing the example first would have saved me from that off-by-one bug."*
- *"Getting stuck for 3 minutes is normal. Giving up at 30 seconds is the real problem."*
