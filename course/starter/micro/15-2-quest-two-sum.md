## 🎯 Try the Problem First

Open the problem on LeetCode and attempt it **before** reading hints or solutions.

**[→ Open Two Sum on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)**

> ⚔ **Mentor's rule:** Spend at least 5 minutes with pen and paper. Apply today's skill: **Belonging Milestone**. The hints below are for *after* your attempt.

## The Problem

See the full problem statement, examples, and constraints on LeetCode.

**[Two Sum #1](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)**

---

## 💡 Hints

1. Re-read the constraints — what edge cases do they hint at?
2. Trace Example 1 by hand before writing any code
3. Start with the simplest approach that could work (brute force is fine)

## 🔍 Strategy Breakdown

**Skill practiced today:** Belonging Milestone

**Why this problem:** Most famous LC problem; symbolic "you belong here" milestone

**How to read this problem:**
1. What is the input? What is the output?
2. What do the examples tell you about the expected behavior?
3. What's the simplest approach that handles all examples?

**How a mentor thinks (before coding):**
1. *"I've seen this type — it's about belonging milestone."*
2. *"Let me trace Example 1 on paper first."*
3. *"What's my brute force? Does it fit the constraints?"*
4. *"Only then do I open my editor."*

## ❌ Why Jumping to Code Fails

| Approach | Problem |
|---|---|
| Open editor immediately | You code before understanding — bugs multiply |
| Skip example tracing | You miss edge cases the examples reveal |
| Copy without understanding | You can't re-solve tomorrow without the editorial |
| Give up before 5 minutes | You never build the "attempt first" habit |

> **The insight:** Speed comes from **process**, not from skipping steps.

## 📖 Walkthrough

Trace Example 1 on paper step by step. Write your brute force in plain English (3 lines). Only then translate to code.

> 💡 **The code is just the paper trace written in syntax.**

## Solution

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int, int> seen;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int need = target - nums[i];
            if (seen.count(need)) return {seen[need], i};
            seen[nums[i]] = i;
        }
        return {};
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        seen = {}
        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            if target - n in seen:
                return [seen[target - n], i]
            seen[n] = i
        return []
```

### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int need = target - nums[i];
            if (seen.containsKey(need)) return new int[]{seen.get(need), i};
            seen.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[]{};
    }
}
```

**Complexity:** O(n) time · O(n) space

## 💭 What a Mentor Would Tell You

- *"I didn't need the optimal solution — I needed a **correct** solution with a clear process."*
- *"Tracing the example first would have saved me from that off-by-one bug."*
- *"Getting stuck for 3 minutes is normal. Giving up at 30 seconds is the real problem."*
