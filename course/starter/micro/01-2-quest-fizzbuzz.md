## 🎯 Try the Problem First

Open the problem on LeetCode and attempt it **before** reading hints or solutions.

**[→ Open FizzBuzz on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizzbuzz/)**

> ⚔ **Mentor's rule:** Spend at least 5 minutes with pen and paper. Apply today's skill: **First Submission Workflow**. The hints below are for *after* your attempt.

## The Problem

Given the problem on LeetCode, apply today's skill: **First Submission Workflow**.

**[→ Open FizzBuzz on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizzbuzz/)** for the full statement, examples, and constraints.

---

## 💡 Hints

1. Re-read the constraints — what edge cases do they hint at?
2. Trace Example 1 by hand before writing any code
3. Start with the simplest approach that could work (brute force is fine)
4. For FizzBuzz: handle divisibility by 3 and 5 separately, then combine

## 🔍 Strategy Breakdown

**Skill practiced today:** First Submission Workflow

**Why this problem:** Lowest-friction first AC; teaches submit/run flow, not algorithms

**How to read this problem:**
1. What is the input? What is the output?
2. What do the examples tell you about the expected behavior?
3. What's the simplest approach that handles all examples?

**How a mentor thinks (before coding):**
1. *"I've seen this type — it's about first submission workflow."*
2. *"Let me trace Example 1 on paper first."*
3. *"What's my brute force? Does it fit the constraints?"*
4. *"Only then do I open my editor."*

## ❌ Why Jumping to Code Fails

| Approach | Problem |
|---|---|
| Open editor immediately | You code before understanding — bugs multiply |
| Skip example tracing | You miss edge cases the examples reveal |
| Copy without understanding | You can't re-solve tomorrow without the editorial |
| Give up before 5 minutes | You never build the "attempt first" habit |

> **The insight:** Speed comes from **process**, not from skipping steps.

## 📖 Walkthrough

Trace Example 1 on paper step by step. Write your brute force in plain English (3 lines). Only then translate to code.

> 💡 **The code is just the paper trace written in syntax.**

## Solution

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> fizzBuzz(int n) {
        vector<string> res;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (i % 15 == 0) res.push_back("FizzBuzz");
            else if (i % 3 == 0) res.push_back("Fizz");
            else if (i % 5 == 0) res.push_back("Buzz");
            else res.push_back(to_string(i));
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def fizzBuzz(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        res = []
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i % 15 == 0: res.append("FizzBuzz")
            elif i % 3 == 0: res.append("Fizz")
            elif i % 5 == 0: res.append("Buzz")
            else: res.append(str(i))
        return res
```

### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> fizzBuzz(int n) {
        List<String> res = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (i % 15 == 0) res.add("FizzBuzz");
            else if (i % 3 == 0) res.add("Fizz");
            else if (i % 5 == 0) res.add("Buzz");
            else res.add(String.valueOf(i));
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

**Complexity:** O(n) time · O(1) space

## 💭 What a Mentor Would Tell You

- *"I didn't need the optimal solution — I needed a **correct** solution with a clear process."*
- *"Tracing the example first would have saved me from that off-by-one bug."*
- *"Getting stuck for 3 minutes is normal. Giving up at 30 seconds is the real problem."*
