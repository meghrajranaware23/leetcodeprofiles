## 🎯 Try the Problem First

Open the problem on LeetCode and attempt it **before** reading hints or solutions.

**[→ Open Roman to Integer on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)**

> ⚔ **Mentor's rule:** Spend at least 5 minutes with pen and paper. Apply today's skill: **Careful Implementation**. The hints below are for *after* your attempt.

## The Problem

See the full problem statement, examples, and constraints on LeetCode.

**[Roman to Integer #13](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)**

---

## 💡 Hints

1. Re-read the constraints — what edge cases do they hint at?
2. Trace Example 1 by hand before writing any code
3. Start with the simplest approach that could work (brute force is fine)

## 🔍 Strategy Breakdown

**Skill practiced today:** Careful Implementation

**Why this problem:** Parsing practice; builds careful implementation habits

**How to read this problem:**
1. What is the input? What is the output?
2. What do the examples tell you about the expected behavior?
3. What's the simplest approach that handles all examples?

**How a mentor thinks (before coding):**
1. *"I've seen this type — it's about careful implementation."*
2. *"Let me trace Example 1 on paper first."*
3. *"What's my brute force? Does it fit the constraints?"*
4. *"Only then do I open my editor."*

## ❌ Why Jumping to Code Fails

| Approach | Problem |
|---|---|
| Open editor immediately | You code before understanding — bugs multiply |
| Skip example tracing | You miss edge cases the examples reveal |
| Copy without understanding | You can't re-solve tomorrow without the editorial |
| Give up before 5 minutes | You never build the "attempt first" habit |

> **The insight:** Speed comes from **process**, not from skipping steps.

## 📖 Walkthrough

Trace Example 1 on paper step by step. Write your brute force in plain English (3 lines). Only then translate to code.

> 💡 **The code is just the paper trace written in syntax.**

## Solution

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int romanToInt(string s) {
        unordered_map<char,int> m = {{'I',1},{'V',5},{'X',10},{'L',50},{'C',100},{'D',500},{'M',1000}};
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (i + 1 < s.size() && m[s[i]] < m[s[i+1]]) ans -= m[s[i]];
            else ans += m[s[i]];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        m = {'I':1,'V':5,'X':10,'L':50,'C':100,'D':500,'M':1000}
        ans = 0
        for i, ch in enumerate(s):
            if i + 1 < len(s) and m[ch] < m[s[i+1]]: ans -= m[ch]
            else: ans += m[ch]
        return ans
```

### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public int romanToInt(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> m = Map.of('I',1,'V',5,'X',10,'L',50,'C',100,'D',500,'M',1000);
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (i + 1 < s.length() && m.get(s.charAt(i)) < m.get(s.charAt(i+1))) ans -= m.get(s.charAt(i));
            else ans += m.get(s.charAt(i));
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

## 💭 What a Mentor Would Tell You

- *"I didn't need the optimal solution — I needed a **correct** solution with a clear process."*
- *"Tracing the example first would have saved me from that off-by-one bug."*
- *"Getting stuck for 3 minutes is normal. Giving up at 30 seconds is the real problem."*
