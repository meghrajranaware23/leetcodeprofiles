## 💡 Hints

Which pattern from today's concept applies? Think about **Topological Sort**.

If you're stuck after 5 minutes: revisit the concept page's visual walkthrough. Draw the graph and trace BFS/DFS by hand before looking at the solution structure.

## 🔍 Pattern Recognition Breakdown

**Pattern used:** Topological Sort

**How to identify this from the problem statement:**
- Look for graph structure keywords — "node", "edge", "connected", "adjacent", "grid"
- Ask: do I need **BFS** (shortest/levels), **DFS** (connectivity/cycles), or **Dijkstra** (weighted)?
- Check if the input is explicit graph, implicit grid, or abstract state space

| Keyword / phrase | What it signals |
|---|---|
| "shortest path" / "minimum steps" | BFS with visited set |
| "connected" / "reachable" | DFS/BFS from source |
| "grid" / "island" / "matrix" | Grid-as-graph traversal |
| "prerequisites" / "dependencies" | Topological sort |
| "bipartite" / "two teams" | Graph 2-coloring |
| "union" / "merge" / "equivalent" | Union-Find |
| "minimum cost" / "network delay" | Dijkstra |

**Why this pattern works:** Graphs model relationships. The pattern names how you explore those relationships — wavefront (BFS), deep dive (DFS), or group merging (UF).

**How a strong solver thinks before coding:**
1. *"What are my nodes? What are my edges?"*
2. *"BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, or Union-Find?"*
3. *"Draw a small example graph and trace by hand."*
4. *"What goes in my visited set?"*

## ❌ Why Brute Force Fails

| Approach | Problem |
|---|---|
| **Try all paths without pruning** | Exponential time — visited set is essential |
| **DFS for shortest unweighted path** | BFS guarantees minimum steps |
| **Dijkstra on unweighted graph** | BFS is simpler and equally correct |
| **Nested loops for connectivity** | O(n²) when O(n) BFS/DFS works |

**The insight brute force misses:** Name the exploration strategy. BFS for shortest, DFS for connectivity, Dijkstra for weighted — then add a visited set.

## 🔗 Same Pattern, Other Problems

| Problem | What changes | Pattern stays the same |
|---|---|---|
| Related tree problems | Different combine logic | Same recursive skeleton |
| Same traversal order | Different processing per node | Same visit sequence |
| Variant constraints | Extra state or early termination | Same flow direction |

If you recognized this problem's pattern, you already have the skeleton for today's practice queue.

## 📖 Walkthrough

Trace the pattern on a small graph before reading the code:

```
Graph:  A — B — C
        |       |
        D — E   F

Apply Topological Sort step by step on this graph.
Draw it. Mark visited nodes at each step.
Watch the queue/stack grow and shrink.
```

> 💡 **The insight:** The code is just the paper trace written in syntax. If you can trace it by hand, you can code it.

## Solution

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findOrder(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj(numCourses);
        vector<int> indeg(numCourses);
        for (auto& p : prerequisites) {
            adj[p[1]].push_back(p[0]);
            indeg[p[0]]++;
        }
        queue<int> q;
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++)
            if (!indeg[i]) q.push(i);
        vector<int> order;
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int u = q.front(); q.pop();
            order.push_back(u);
            for (int v : adj[u])
                if (--indeg[v] == 0) q.push(v);
        }
        return (int)order.size() == numCourses ? order : vector<int>{};
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findOrder(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        adj = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]
        indeg = [0] * numCourses
        for a, b in prerequisites:
            adj[b].append(a)
            indeg[a] += 1
        q = deque(i for i in range(numCourses) if indeg[i] == 0)
        order = []
        while q:
            u = q.popleft()
            order.append(u)
            for v in adj[u]:
                indeg[v] -= 1
                if indeg[v] == 0:
                    q.append(v)
        return order if len(order) == numCourses else []
```

### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findOrder(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        List<List<Integer>> adj = new ArrayList<>();
        int[] indeg = new int[numCourses];
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) adj.add(new ArrayList<>());
        for (int[] p : prerequisites) { adj.get(p[1]).add(p[0]); indeg[p[0]]++; }
        Queue<Integer> q = new ArrayDeque<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) if (indeg[i] == 0) q.offer(i);
        int[] order = new int[numCourses];
        int idx = 0;
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int u = q.poll(); order[idx++] = u;
            for (int v : adj.get(u)) if (--indeg[v] == 0) q.offer(v);
        }
        return idx == numCourses ? order : new int[0];
    }
}
```

**Complexity:** O(V + E) time · O(V + E) space

## 💭 What Should Have Clicked in Your Mind?

Before writing code, a strong solver's internal monologue sounds like this:

- **"This is a graph problem"** → Draw it. Identify nodes and edges first.
- **"Topological Sort"** → Name the pattern from the concept page.
- **"BFS or DFS?"** → Shortest/levels = BFS. Connectivity/cycles = DFS.
- **"Visited set"** → Every graph traversal needs one.

If you tried DFS when BFS was cleaner (or vice versa), that's fine — the breakthrough is **naming the pattern family**, not memorizing one solution.
