## 💡 Hints

Which pattern from today's concept applies? Think about **DFS + Memo on DAG**.

If you're stuck after 5 minutes: revisit the concept page's visual walkthrough. Draw the graph and trace BFS/DFS by hand before looking at the solution structure.

## 🔍 Pattern Recognition Breakdown

**Pattern used:** DFS + Memo on DAG

**How to identify this from the problem statement:**
- Look for graph structure keywords — "node", "edge", "connected", "adjacent", "grid"
- Ask: do I need **BFS** (shortest/levels), **DFS** (connectivity/cycles), or **Dijkstra** (weighted)?
- Check if the input is explicit graph, implicit grid, or abstract state space

| Keyword / phrase | What it signals |
|---|---|
| "shortest path" / "minimum steps" | BFS with visited set |
| "connected" / "reachable" | DFS/BFS from source |
| "grid" / "island" / "matrix" | Grid-as-graph traversal |
| "prerequisites" / "dependencies" | Topological sort |
| "bipartite" / "two teams" | Graph 2-coloring |
| "union" / "merge" / "equivalent" | Union-Find |
| "minimum cost" / "network delay" | Dijkstra |

**Why this pattern works:** Graphs model relationships. The pattern names how you explore those relationships — wavefront (BFS), deep dive (DFS), or group merging (UF).

**How a strong solver thinks before coding:**
1. *"What are my nodes? What are my edges?"*
2. *"BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, or Union-Find?"*
3. *"Draw a small example graph and trace by hand."*
4. *"What goes in my visited set?"*

## ❌ Why Brute Force Fails

| Approach | Problem |
|---|---|
| **Try all paths without pruning** | Exponential time — visited set is essential |
| **DFS for shortest unweighted path** | BFS guarantees minimum steps |
| **Dijkstra on unweighted graph** | BFS is simpler and equally correct |
| **Nested loops for connectivity** | O(n²) when O(n) BFS/DFS works |

**The insight brute force misses:** Name the exploration strategy. BFS for shortest, DFS for connectivity, Dijkstra for weighted — then add a visited set.

## 🔗 Same Pattern, Other Problems

| Problem | What changes | Pattern stays the same |
|---|---|---|
| Related tree problems | Different combine logic | Same recursive skeleton |
| Same traversal order | Different processing per node | Same visit sequence |
| Variant constraints | Extra state or early termination | Same flow direction |

If you recognized this problem's pattern, you already have the skeleton for today's practice queue.

## 📖 Walkthrough

Trace the pattern on a small graph before reading the code:

```
Graph:  A — B — C
        |       |
        D — E   F

Apply DFS + Memo on DAG step by step on this graph.
Draw it. Mark visited nodes at each step.
Watch the queue/stack grow and shrink.
```

> 💡 **The insight:** The code is just the paper trace written in syntax. If you can trace it by hand, you can code it.

## Solution

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
    int m, n, dirs[4][2] = {{1,0},{-1,0},{0,1},{0,-1}};
    int dfs(vector<vector<int>>& mat, vector<vector<int>>& dp, int r, int c) {
        if (dp[r][c]) return dp[r][c];
        int best = 1;
        for (auto& d : dirs) {
            int nr = r + d[0], nc = c + d[1];
            if (nr >= 0 && nc >= 0 && nr < m && nc < n && mat[nr][nc] > mat[r][c])
                best = max(best, 1 + dfs(mat, dp, nr, nc));
        }
        return dp[r][c] = best;
    }
public:
    int longestIncreasingPath(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        m = matrix.size(); if (!m) return 0;
        n = matrix[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n));
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                ans = max(ans, dfs(matrix, dp, i, j));
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def longestIncreasingPath(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        def dfs(r, c):
            if dp[r][c]: return dp[r][c]
            best = 1
            for dr, dc in ((1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)):
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < m and 0 <= nc < n and matrix[nr][nc] > matrix[r][c]:
                    best = max(best, 1 + dfs(nr, nc))
            dp[r][c] = best
            return best
        return max(dfs(i, j) for i in range(m) for j in range(n))
```

### Java
```java
class Solution {
    private int m, n;
    private int[][] dp;
    public int longestIncreasingPath(int[][] matrix) {
        m = matrix.length; n = matrix[0].length;
        dp = new int[m][n];
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                ans = Math.max(ans, dfs(matrix, i, j));
        return ans;
    }
    private int dfs(int[][] matrix, int r, int c) {
        if (dp[r][c] != 0) return dp[r][c];
        int best = 1;
        int[][] dirs = {{1,0},{-1,0},{0,1},{0,-1}};
        for (int[] d : dirs) {
            int nr = r + d[0], nc = c + d[1];
            if (nr >= 0 && nc >= 0 && nr < m && nc < n && matrix[nr][nc] > matrix[r][c])
                best = Math.max(best, 1 + dfs(matrix, nr, nc));
        }
        return dp[r][c] = best;
    }
}
```

**Complexity:** O(m · n) time · O(m · n) space

## 💭 What Should Have Clicked in Your Mind?

Before writing code, a strong solver's internal monologue sounds like this:

- **"This is a graph problem"** → Draw it. Identify nodes and edges first.
- **"DFS + Memo on DAG"** → Name the pattern from the concept page.
- **"BFS or DFS?"** → Shortest/levels = BFS. Connectivity/cycles = DFS.
- **"Visited set"** → Every graph traversal needs one.

If you tried DFS when BFS was cleaner (or vice versa), that's fine — the breakthrough is **naming the pattern family**, not memorizing one solution.
