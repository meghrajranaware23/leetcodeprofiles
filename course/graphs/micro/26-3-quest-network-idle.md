## 💡 Hints

Which pattern from today's concept applies? Think about **Tree BFS + Bottleneck**.

If you're stuck after 5 minutes: revisit the concept page's visual walkthrough. Draw the graph and trace BFS/DFS by hand before looking at the solution structure.

## 🔍 Pattern Recognition Breakdown

**Pattern used:** Tree BFS + Bottleneck

**How to identify this from the problem statement:**
- Look for graph structure keywords — "node", "edge", "connected", "adjacent", "grid"
- Ask: do I need **BFS** (shortest/levels), **DFS** (connectivity/cycles), or **Dijkstra** (weighted)?
- Check if the input is explicit graph, implicit grid, or abstract state space

| Keyword / phrase | What it signals |
|---|---|
| "shortest path" / "minimum steps" | BFS with visited set |
| "connected" / "reachable" | DFS/BFS from source |
| "grid" / "island" / "matrix" | Grid-as-graph traversal |
| "prerequisites" / "dependencies" | Topological sort |
| "bipartite" / "two teams" | Graph 2-coloring |
| "union" / "merge" / "equivalent" | Union-Find |
| "minimum cost" / "network delay" | Dijkstra |

**Why this pattern works:** Graphs model relationships. The pattern names how you explore those relationships — wavefront (BFS), deep dive (DFS), or group merging (UF).

**How a strong solver thinks before coding:**
1. *"What are my nodes? What are my edges?"*
2. *"BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, or Union-Find?"*
3. *"Draw a small example graph and trace by hand."*
4. *"What goes in my visited set?"*

## ❌ Why Brute Force Fails

| Approach | Problem |
|---|---|
| **Try all paths without pruning** | Exponential time — visited set is essential |
| **DFS for shortest unweighted path** | BFS guarantees minimum steps |
| **Dijkstra on unweighted graph** | BFS is simpler and equally correct |
| **Nested loops for connectivity** | O(n²) when O(n) BFS/DFS works |

**The insight brute force misses:** Name the exploration strategy. BFS for shortest, DFS for connectivity, Dijkstra for weighted — then add a visited set.

## 🔗 Same Pattern, Other Problems

| Problem | What changes | Pattern stays the same |
|---|---|---|
| Related tree problems | Different combine logic | Same recursive skeleton |
| Same traversal order | Different processing per node | Same visit sequence |
| Variant constraints | Extra state or early termination | Same flow direction |

If you recognized this problem's pattern, you already have the skeleton for today's practice queue.

## 📖 Walkthrough

Trace the pattern on a small graph before reading the code:

```
Graph:  A — B — C
        |       |
        D — E   F

Apply Tree BFS + Bottleneck step by step on this graph.
Draw it. Mark visited nodes at each step.
Watch the queue/stack grow and shrink.
```

> 💡 **The insight:** The code is just the paper trace written in syntax. If you can trace it by hand, you can code it.

## Solution

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int networkBecomesIdle(vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& patience) {
        int n = patience.size();
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
        for (auto& e : edges) { adj[e[0]].push_back(e[1]); adj[e[1]].push_back(e[0]); }
        vector<int> dist(n, -1);
        queue<int> q;
        q.push(0); dist[0] = 0;
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int u = q.front(); q.pop();
            for (int v : adj[u])
                if (dist[v] == -1) { dist[v] = dist[u] + 1; q.push(v); }
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int roundTrip = 2 * dist[i];
            int lastSend = ((roundTrip - 1) / patience[i]) * patience[i];
            ans = max(ans, lastSend + roundTrip);
        }
        return ans + 1;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def networkBecomesIdle(self, edges: List[List[int]], patience: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(patience)
        adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for u, v in edges:
            adj[u].append(v); adj[v].append(u)
        dist = [-1] * n
        q = deque([0])
        dist[0] = 0
        while q:
            u = q.popleft()
            for v in adj[u]:
                if dist[v] == -1:
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + 1
                    q.append(v)
        ans = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            rt = 2 * dist[i]
            last = ((rt - 1) // patience[i]) * patience[i]
            ans = max(ans, last + rt)
        return ans + 1
```

### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public int networkBecomesIdle(int[][] edges, int[] patience) {
        int n = patience.length;
        List<List<Integer>> adj = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) adj.add(new ArrayList<>());
        for (int[] e : edges) { adj.get(e[0]).add(e[1]); adj.get(e[1]).add(e[0]); }
        int[] dist = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(dist, -1);
        Queue<Integer> q = new ArrayDeque<>();
        q.offer(0); dist[0] = 0;
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int u = q.poll();
            for (int v : adj.get(u))
                if (dist[v] == -1) { dist[v] = dist[u] + 1; q.offer(v); }
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int rt = 2 * dist[i];
            int last = ((rt - 1) / patience[i]) * patience[i];
            ans = Math.max(ans, last + rt);
        }
        return ans + 1;
    }
}
```

**Complexity:** O(V + E) time · O(V + E) space

## 💭 What Should Have Clicked in Your Mind?

Before writing code, a strong solver's internal monologue sounds like this:

- **"This is a graph problem"** → Draw it. Identify nodes and edges first.
- **"Tree BFS + Bottleneck"** → Name the pattern from the concept page.
- **"BFS or DFS?"** → Shortest/levels = BFS. Connectivity/cycles = DFS.
- **"Visited set"** → Every graph traversal needs one.

If you tried DFS when BFS was cleaner (or vice versa), that's fine — the breakthrough is **naming the pattern family**, not memorizing one solution.
