## 💡 Hints

Which pattern from today's concept applies? Think about **Dijkstra from Each Node**.

If you're stuck after 5 minutes: revisit the concept page's visual walkthrough. Draw the graph and trace BFS/DFS by hand before looking at the solution structure.

## 🔍 Pattern Recognition Breakdown

**Pattern used:** Dijkstra from Each Node

**How to identify this from the problem statement:**
- Look for graph structure keywords — "node", "edge", "connected", "adjacent", "grid"
- Ask: do I need **BFS** (shortest/levels), **DFS** (connectivity/cycles), or **Dijkstra** (weighted)?
- Check if the input is explicit graph, implicit grid, or abstract state space

| Keyword / phrase | What it signals |
|---|---|
| "shortest path" / "minimum steps" | BFS with visited set |
| "connected" / "reachable" | DFS/BFS from source |
| "grid" / "island" / "matrix" | Grid-as-graph traversal |
| "prerequisites" / "dependencies" | Topological sort |
| "bipartite" / "two teams" | Graph 2-coloring |
| "union" / "merge" / "equivalent" | Union-Find |
| "minimum cost" / "network delay" | Dijkstra |

**Why this pattern works:** Graphs model relationships. The pattern names how you explore those relationships — wavefront (BFS), deep dive (DFS), or group merging (UF).

**How a strong solver thinks before coding:**
1. *"What are my nodes? What are my edges?"*
2. *"BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, or Union-Find?"*
3. *"Draw a small example graph and trace by hand."*
4. *"What goes in my visited set?"*

## ❌ Why Brute Force Fails

| Approach | Problem |
|---|---|
| **Try all paths without pruning** | Exponential time — visited set is essential |
| **DFS for shortest unweighted path** | BFS guarantees minimum steps |
| **Dijkstra on unweighted graph** | BFS is simpler and equally correct |
| **Nested loops for connectivity** | O(n²) when O(n) BFS/DFS works |

**The insight brute force misses:** Name the exploration strategy. BFS for shortest, DFS for connectivity, Dijkstra for weighted — then add a visited set.

## 🔗 Same Pattern, Other Problems

| Problem | What changes | Pattern stays the same |
|---|---|---|
| Related tree problems | Different combine logic | Same recursive skeleton |
| Same traversal order | Different processing per node | Same visit sequence |
| Variant constraints | Extra state or early termination | Same flow direction |

If you recognized this problem's pattern, you already have the skeleton for today's practice queue.

## 📖 Walkthrough

Trace the pattern on a small graph before reading the code:

```
Graph:  A — B — C
        |       |
        D — E   F

Apply Dijkstra from Each Node step by step on this graph.
Draw it. Mark visited nodes at each step.
Watch the queue/stack grow and shrink.
```

> 💡 **The insight:** The code is just the paper trace written in syntax. If you can trace it by hand, you can code it.

## Solution

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findTheCity(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int distanceThreshold) {
        vector<vector<int>> dist(n, vector<int>(n, 1e9));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) dist[i][i] = 0;
        for (auto& e : edges) dist[e[0]][e[1]] = dist[e[1]][e[0]] = e[2];
        for (int k = 0; k < n; k++)
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                    dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]);
        int best = -1, minReach = n + 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int reach = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                if (dist[i][j] <= distanceThreshold) reach++;
            if (reach <= minReach) { minReach = reach; best = i; }
        }
        return best;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def findTheCity(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], distanceThreshold: int) -> int:
        dist = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(n): dist[i][i] = 0
        for u, v, w in edges:
            dist[u][v] = dist[v][u] = w
        for k in range(n):
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(n):
                    dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])
        best, min_reach = -1, n + 1
        for i in range(n):
            reach = sum(1 for j in range(n) if dist[i][j] <= distanceThreshold)
            if reach <= min_reach:
                min_reach = reach
                best = i
        return best
```

### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public int findTheCity(int n, int[][] edges, int distanceThreshold) {
        int[][] dist = new int[n][n];
        for (int[] row : dist) Arrays.fill(row, 1_000_000_000);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) dist[i][i] = 0;
        for (int[] e : edges) { dist[e[0]][e[1]] = e[2]; dist[e[1]][e[0]] = e[2]; }
        for (int k = 0; k < n; k++)
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                    dist[i][j] = Math.min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]);
        int best = -1, minReach = n + 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int reach = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) if (dist[i][j] <= distanceThreshold) reach++;
            if (reach <= minReach) { minReach = reach; best = i; }
        }
        return best;
    }
}
```

**Complexity:** O(n³) time · O(n²) space

## 💭 What Should Have Clicked in Your Mind?

Before writing code, a strong solver's internal monologue sounds like this:

- **"This is a graph problem"** → Draw it. Identify nodes and edges first.
- **"Dijkstra from Each Node"** → Name the pattern from the concept page.
- **"BFS or DFS?"** → Shortest/levels = BFS. Connectivity/cycles = DFS.
- **"Visited set"** → Every graph traversal needs one.

If you tried DFS when BFS was cleaner (or vice versa), that's fine — the breakthrough is **naming the pattern family**, not memorizing one solution.
