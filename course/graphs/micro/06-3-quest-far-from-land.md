## 💡 Hints

Which pattern from today's concept applies? Think about **Multi-Source BFS on Grid**.

If you're stuck after 5 minutes: revisit the concept page's visual walkthrough. Draw the graph and trace BFS/DFS by hand before looking at the solution structure.

## 🔍 Pattern Recognition Breakdown

**Pattern used:** Multi-Source BFS on Grid

**How to identify this from the problem statement:**
- Look for graph structure keywords — "node", "edge", "connected", "adjacent", "grid"
- Ask: do I need **BFS** (shortest/levels), **DFS** (connectivity/cycles), or **Dijkstra** (weighted)?
- Check if the input is explicit graph, implicit grid, or abstract state space

| Keyword / phrase | What it signals |
|---|---|
| "shortest path" / "minimum steps" | BFS with visited set |
| "connected" / "reachable" | DFS/BFS from source |
| "grid" / "island" / "matrix" | Grid-as-graph traversal |
| "prerequisites" / "dependencies" | Topological sort |
| "bipartite" / "two teams" | Graph 2-coloring |
| "union" / "merge" / "equivalent" | Union-Find |
| "minimum cost" / "network delay" | Dijkstra |

**Why this pattern works:** Graphs model relationships. The pattern names how you explore those relationships — wavefront (BFS), deep dive (DFS), or group merging (UF).

**How a strong solver thinks before coding:**
1. *"What are my nodes? What are my edges?"*
2. *"BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, or Union-Find?"*
3. *"Draw a small example graph and trace by hand."*
4. *"What goes in my visited set?"*

## ❌ Why Brute Force Fails

| Approach | Problem |
|---|---|
| **Try all paths without pruning** | Exponential time — visited set is essential |
| **DFS for shortest unweighted path** | BFS guarantees minimum steps |
| **Dijkstra on unweighted graph** | BFS is simpler and equally correct |
| **Nested loops for connectivity** | O(n²) when O(n) BFS/DFS works |

**The insight brute force misses:** Name the exploration strategy. BFS for shortest, DFS for connectivity, Dijkstra for weighted — then add a visited set.

## 🔗 Same Pattern, Other Problems

| Problem | What changes | Pattern stays the same |
|---|---|---|
| Related tree problems | Different combine logic | Same recursive skeleton |
| Same traversal order | Different processing per node | Same visit sequence |
| Variant constraints | Extra state or early termination | Same flow direction |

If you recognized this problem's pattern, you already have the skeleton for today's practice queue.

## 📖 Walkthrough

Trace the pattern on a small graph before reading the code:

```
Graph:  A — B — C
        |       |
        D — E   F

Apply Multi-Source BFS on Grid step by step on this graph.
Draw it. Mark visited nodes at each step.
Watch the queue/stack grow and shrink.
```

> 💡 **The insight:** The code is just the paper trace written in syntax. If you can trace it by hand, you can code it.

## Solution

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDistance(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
        queue<pair<int,int>> q;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                if (grid[i][j]) q.push({i, j});
        if (q.empty() || (int)q.size() == m * n) return -1;
        int dirs[4][2] = {{1,0},{-1,0},{0,1},{0,-1}}, dist = -1;
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int sz = q.size();
            dist++;
            while (sz--) {
                auto [r,c] = q.front(); q.pop();
                for (auto& d : dirs) {
                    int nr = r + d[0], nc = c + d[1];
                    if (nr >= 0 && nc >= 0 && nr < m && nc < n && !grid[nr][nc]) {
                        grid[nr][nc] = 1;
                        q.push({nr, nc});
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return dist;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxDistance(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        q = deque((i, j) for i in range(m) for j in range(n) if grid[i][j])
        if not q or len(q) == m * n: return -1
        dist = -1
        while q:
            for _ in range(len(q)):
                r, c = q.popleft()
                for dr, dc in ((1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)):
                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < m and 0 <= nc < n and not grid[nr][nc]:
                        grid[nr][nc] = 1
                        q.append((nr, nc))
            dist += 1
        return dist
```

### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDistance(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
        Queue<int[]> q = new ArrayDeque<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) q.offer(new int[]{i, j});
        if (q.isEmpty() || q.size() == m * n) return -1;
        int dist = -1;
        int[][] dirs = {{1,0},{-1,0},{0,1},{0,-1}};
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int sz = q.size();
            dist++;
            for (int k = 0; k < sz; k++) {
                int[] cur = q.poll();
                for (int[] d : dirs) {
                    int nr = cur[0] + d[0], nc = cur[1] + d[1];
                    if (nr >= 0 && nc >= 0 && nr < m && nc < n && grid[nr][nc] == 0) {
                        grid[nr][nc] = 1;
                        q.offer(new int[]{nr, nc});
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return dist;
    }
}
```

**Complexity:** O(m · n) time · O(m · n) space

## 💭 What Should Have Clicked in Your Mind?

Before writing code, a strong solver's internal monologue sounds like this:

- **"This is a graph problem"** → Draw it. Identify nodes and edges first.
- **"Multi-Source BFS on Grid"** → Name the pattern from the concept page.
- **"BFS or DFS?"** → Shortest/levels = BFS. Connectivity/cycles = DFS.
- **"Visited set"** → Every graph traversal needs one.

If you tried DFS when BFS was cleaner (or vice versa), that's fine — the breakthrough is **naming the pattern family**, not memorizing one solution.
