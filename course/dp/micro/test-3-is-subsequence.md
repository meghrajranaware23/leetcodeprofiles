# ⚔ E-Rank Test — Problem 3

> [Is Subsequence #392](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/) · Easy · 100 XP

---

You've completed your E-Rank training. Now prove your foundation.

## 🎯 Try the Problem First

Open the problem on LeetCode and attempt it for **at least 15 minutes** before revealing hints or solutions.

**[→ Open Is Subsequence on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)**

> ⚔ **Hunter's rule:** This is a rank test — treat it like real interview practice. Define the state. Write the transition. Fill the table by hand. No peeking until you've genuinely tried.

## The Problem

See the full problem statement on LeetCode: **[Is Subsequence #392](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)**

---

## 💡 Hints

> 🎯 **What's being tested:** Pattern recognition from the E-Rank curriculum. Define the state and transition before you code.

Revisit your rank's cheat sheet. Is this linear DP, grid DP, knapsack, or state machine?

## 🔍 Pattern Recognition Breakdown

**How to identify from the statement:**
- What is the state? What information describes a subproblem?
- What are the choices at each state?
- What's the transition formula?

**How a strong solver thinks before coding:**
1. *"What does dp[i] represent?"*
2. *"What's the base case?"*
3. *"Linear, grid, knapsack, or state machine?"*
4. *"Can I optimize the space?"*

## ❌ Why Brute Force Fails

DP problems have exponential recursion trees with massive overlap. Brute force means recomputing the same subproblems O(2^n) times. Define the state, cache it, and solve each subproblem exactly once.

---

## 🎯 Transfer to Unseen Problems

Can you define the state without the problem name telling you the pattern?

Read the statement once. Define dp[i] in one sentence. If you can write the transition in under 60 seconds, you're ready.

<summary><strong>📖 Solution & Walkthrough</strong></summary>

Fill the DP table for the given example. Trace which cells each cell depends on. Then implement the transition.

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int i = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < (int)t.size() && i < (int)s.size(); j++)
            if (s[i] == t[j]) i++;
        return i == (int)s.size();
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        i = 0
        for c in t:
            if i < len(s) and c == s[i]:
                i += 1
        return i == len(s)
```

### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        int i = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < t.length() && i < s.length(); j++)
            if (s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)) i++;
        return i == s.length();
    }
}
```

**Complexity:** O(n) time · O(1) space

## 💭 What Should Have Clicked in Your Mind?

- **"This is a E-Rank test"** → Use patterns from this rank's training.
- **"State first, code second"** → Define dp[i] before writing any code.
- **"Name the pattern"** → The code is just the transition formula in syntax.
