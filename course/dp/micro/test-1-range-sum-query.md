---

You've completed your E-Rank training. Now prove your foundation.

## 🎯 Try the Problem First

Open the problem on LeetCode and attempt it for **at least 15 minutes** before revealing hints or solutions.

**[→ Open Range Sum Query - Immutable on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-immutable/)**

> ⚔ **Hunter's rule:** This is a rank test — treat it like real interview practice. Define the state. Write the transition. Fill the table by hand. No peeking until you've genuinely tried.

## The Problem

See the full problem statement on LeetCode: **[Range Sum Query - Immutable #303](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-immutable/)**

---

## 💡 Hints

> 🎯 **What's being tested:** Pattern recognition from the E-Rank curriculum. Define the state and transition before you code.

Revisit your rank's cheat sheet. Is this linear DP, grid DP, knapsack, or state machine?

## 🔍 Pattern Recognition Breakdown

**How to identify from the statement:**
- What is the state? What information describes a subproblem?
- What are the choices at each state?
- What's the transition formula?

**How a strong solver thinks before coding:**
1. *"What does dp[i] represent?"*
2. *"What's the base case?"*
3. *"Linear, grid, knapsack, or state machine?"*
4. *"Can I optimize the space?"*

## ❌ Why Brute Force Fails

DP problems have exponential recursion trees with massive overlap. Brute force means recomputing the same subproblems O(2^n) times. Define the state, cache it, and solve each subproblem exactly once.

---

## 🎯 Transfer to Unseen Problems

Can you define the state without the problem name telling you the pattern?

Read the statement once. Define dp[i] in one sentence. If you can write the transition in under 60 seconds, you're ready.

<summary><strong>📖 Solution & Walkthrough</strong></summary>

Fill the DP table for the given example. Trace which cells each cell depends on. Then implement the transition.

### C++
```cpp
class NumArray {
    vector<int> prefix;
public:
    NumArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        prefix.resize(nums.size() + 1, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < (int)nums.size(); i++)
            prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + nums[i];
    }
    int sumRange(int left, int right) {
        return prefix[right + 1] - prefix[left];
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class NumArray:
    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        self.prefix = [0]
        for num in nums:
            self.prefix.append(self.prefix[-1] + num)
    def sumRange(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        return self.prefix[right + 1] - self.prefix[left]
```

### Java
```java
class NumArray {
    int[] prefix;
    public NumArray(int[] nums) {
        prefix = new int[nums.length + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
            prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + nums[i];
    }
    public int sumRange(int left, int right) {
        return prefix[right + 1] - prefix[left];
    }
}
```

**Complexity:** O(n) build · O(1) query · O(n) space

## 💭 What Should Have Clicked in Your Mind?

- **"This is a E-Rank test"** → Use patterns from this rank's training.
- **"State first, code second"** → Define dp[i] before writing any code.
- **"Name the pattern"** → The code is just the transition formula in syntax.
