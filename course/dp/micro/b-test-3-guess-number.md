You've completed your B-Rank training. Now prove your foundation.

## 🎯 Try the Problem First

Open the problem on LeetCode and attempt it for **at least 15 minutes** before revealing hints or solutions.

> ⚔ **Hunter's rule:** This is a rank test — treat it like real interview practice. Define the state. Write the transition. Fill the table by hand. No peeking until you've genuinely tried.

## The Problem

See the full problem statement on LeetCode: **[Guess Number Higher or Lower II #375](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower-ii/)**

---

## 💡 Hints

> 🎯 **What's being tested:** Pattern recognition from the B-Rank curriculum. Define the state and transition before you code.

Revisit your rank's cheat sheet. Is this linear DP, grid DP, knapsack, or state machine?

## 🔍 Pattern Recognition Breakdown

**How to identify from the statement:**
- What is the state? What information describes a subproblem?
- What are the choices at each state?
- What's the transition formula?

**How a strong solver thinks before coding:**
1. *"What does dp[i] represent?"*
2. *"What's the base case?"*
3. *"Linear, grid, knapsack, or state machine?"*
4. *"Can I optimize the space?"*

## ❌ Why Brute Force Fails

DP problems have exponential recursion trees with massive overlap. Brute force means recomputing the same subproblems O(2^n) times. Define the state, cache it, and solve each subproblem exactly once.

---

## 🎯 Transfer to Unseen Problems

Can you define the state without the problem name telling you the pattern?

Read the statement once. Define dp[i] in one sentence. If you can write the transition in under 60 seconds, you're ready.

<summary><strong>📖 Solution & Walkthrough</strong></summary>

Fill the DP table for the given example. Trace which cells each cell depends on. Then implement the transition.

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 2, vector<int>(n + 2, 0));
        for (int len = 2; len <= n; len++)
            for (int i = 1; i + len - 1 <= n; i++) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                dp[i][j] = INT_MAX;
                for (int k = i; k <= j; k++)
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], k + max(dp[i][k - 1], dp[k + 1][j]));
            }
        return dp[1][n];
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def getMoneyAmount(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[0] * (n + 2) for _ in range(n + 2)]
        for length in range(2, n + 1):
            for i in range(1, n - length + 2):
                j = i + length - 1
                dp[i][j] = float('inf')
                for k in range(i, j + 1):
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], k + max(dp[i][k - 1], dp[k + 1][j]))
        return dp[1][n]
```

### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 2][n + 2];
        for (int len = 2; len <= n; len++)
            for (int i = 1; i + len - 1 <= n; i++) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                dp[i][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                for (int k = i; k <= j; k++)
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], k + Math.max(dp[i][k - 1], dp[k + 1][j]));
            }
        return dp[1][n];
    }
}
```

**Complexity:** O(n³) time · O(n²) space

## 💭 What Should Have Clicked in Your Mind?

- **"This is a B-Rank test"** → Use patterns from this rank's training.
- **"State first, code second"** → Define dp[i] before writing any code.
- **"Name the pattern"** → The code is just the transition formula in syntax.
