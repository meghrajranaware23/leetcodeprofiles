## 💡 Hints

Which DP pattern from today's concept applies? Think about **State Machine DP**.

What is the state? What does dp[i] represent for this problem?

If you're stuck after 5 minutes: revisit the concept page's DP Pipeline. Draw the recursion tree. Circle the repeated subproblems. Then fill the DP table left-to-right.

## 🔍 Pattern Recognition Breakdown

**Pattern used:** State Machine DP

**How to identify this from the problem statement:**
- Does the problem ask for an optimal value (min/max) or a count of ways?
- Can the problem be broken into overlapping subproblems?
- Is there a clear decision at each step (take/skip, include/exclude)?

| Keyword / phrase | What it signals |
|---|---|
| "minimum" / "maximum" / "optimal" | DP — optimize over choices |
| "how many ways" / "count" / "number of" | DP — sum transitions |
| "can you reach" / "is it possible" | DP — boolean reachability |
| "longest" / "shortest" subsequence | DP — sequence comparison |
| "partition into" / "subset sum" | Knapsack DP |
| "using at most k" / "with capacity" | Bounded knapsack or state machine |

**Why brute force fails:** Without DP, the recursive solution recomputes the same subproblems exponentially many times. The recursion tree has O(2^n) or O(n!) nodes, but only O(n) or O(n²) unique subproblems.

**How a strong solver thinks before coding:**
1. *"What's the state? What does dp[i] represent?"*
2. *"What are my choices at each state?"*
3. *"What's the transition formula?"*
4. *"What's the base case? What's the answer cell?"*

## ❌ Why Brute Force Fails

| Approach | Problem |
|---|---|
| **Naive recursion without caching** | O(2^n) — same subproblems recomputed exponentially |
| **Trying all subsets with nested loops** | O(2^n) or O(n!) — misses the optimal substructure |
| **Greedy without proof** | Greedy doesn't work when locally optimal ≠ globally optimal |
| **Not identifying the state** | Without a clear state, no way to cache or tabulate |

**The insight brute force misses:** The recursion tree has massive overlap. DP exploits this by solving each unique subproblem exactly once.

```
Exponential tree:           DP table:
     f(5)                   dp: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
    /    \                        → O(n) time
  f(4)   f(3)                     → each cell filled once
  / \    / \
f(3) f(2) f(2) f(1)        Same answer, no repeated work.
 ...  ...  ...
→ O(2^n) calls
```

## 🔗 The DP Pipeline Applied

```
Step 1: BRUTE FORCE
  → Write the naive recursive solution for this problem.

Step 2: IDENTIFY OVERLAP
  → Draw the recursion tree for a small example.
  → Which calls repeat?

Step 3: MEMOIZE
  → Add memo[state] = result before each return.
  → Check memo before recursing.

Step 4: TABULATE
  → Define dp[...]. Fill from base case forward.
  → dp[state] = transition(previous states)

Step 5: OPTIMIZE SPACE
  → Do you need the whole table? Or just prev/curr?
```

## 📖 Walkthrough

Draw the recursion tree. Circle the repeated subproblems. Then fill the DP table left-to-right.

```
Fill the DP table cell by cell for the example from the problem.
At each cell, write which previous cells it depends on.
Watch the transition formula produce the correct value.
```

> 💡 **The insight:** The code is just the table-filling written in syntax. If you can fill the table by hand, you can code it.

## Solution

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int hold = -prices[0], sold = 0, rest = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < (int)prices.size(); i++) {
            int prevHold = hold;
            hold = max(hold, rest - prices[i]);
            rest = max(rest, sold);
            sold = prevHold + prices[i];
        }
        return max(sold, rest);
    }
};
```

### Python
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        hold, sold, rest = -prices[0], 0, 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            prev_hold = hold
            hold = max(hold, rest - prices[i])
            rest = max(rest, sold)
            sold = prev_hold + prices[i]
        return max(sold, rest)
```

### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int hold = -prices[0], sold = 0, rest = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            int prevHold = hold;
            hold = Math.max(hold, rest - prices[i]);
            rest = Math.max(rest, sold);
            sold = prevHold + prices[i];
        }
        return Math.max(sold, rest);
    }
}
```

**Complexity:** O(n) time · O(1) space

## 💭 What Should Have Clicked in Your Mind?

Before writing code, a strong solver's internal monologue sounds like this:

- **"State is..."** → dp[i] represents the answer for the first i elements (or whatever the state is).
- **"Transition is..."** → dp[i] = max/min/sum of (choices connecting to previous states).
- **"Base case is..."** → dp[0] = ... (the smallest subproblem answered directly).
- **"State Machine DP"** → Name the DP pattern from the concept page.

If you tried brute force first, that's fine — the breakthrough is **defining the state and transition**, not memorizing one solution.
